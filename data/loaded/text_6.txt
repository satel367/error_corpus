Yes sure, <those situations are really fresh one> [GR]; [Subject-verb agreement]{2}, it happened a couple of months ago. <We were at the process of migration on backend platform>[GR]; [Prep]_[Function]{1} . So we have a big product: <we sell the books.> [GR]; [Art]_[ZeroArt] {1} And <me and my team was responsible>[GR]; [Subject-verb agreement]{1} for developing a mobile application.

How many users deleted all their bookmarks and it was about 20 users and it happens once in 3-4 hours, <so longer we wait, the more clients will have this experience.>[GR]; [Art]_[DefArt]{1} The second step I came to our customer support team and asked for a feedback for our beta application and <they tell me about those frustration.>[GR]; [Tense]_[PastS]{2} Customer was unhappy about it and I can understand them so <we made a meeting> [LEX]; [Wrong word]_[Noun] {1} which was to make the decision about the situation, because <I wasn’t agree>[GR]; [Auxiliary]{2}  with this decision <to leave it on couple of days.>[GR]; [Prep]_[After verb]{1}  And <I let my team to decide>[GR]; [Infinitive]{1} what we should do with it.
