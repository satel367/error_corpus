I worked today, now it's time to practice my English.
It was nothing special today.
Because I have a goal to <find a new job in international company> [GR]; [Art]_[IndefArt].

That's why <I practice my English with help of Yandex Practicum> [GR]; [Art]_[DefArt].

It's for my new potential job. For my current job English is not required.

The business purpose of this research is to increase the <event > [PRON];[Word stress]_[Event] attendance. 

Speaking of methods of this research, we consider two options: social networks or face to face interviews.

Finally, speaking of constraints, we have time constraints: as usual, the research will be finished in two weeks.

And also money constraints: <we have limited budget> [GR]; [Art]_[IndefArt]. And we need to keep this research as cheap as possible.

Also, we have some questions for discuss. 

Today we are discussing our new UX-research. <Can I describe deeper this task ****for you?> [GR];[Word order]_[Misplaced adverb]/[LEX];[Collocation] .The purpose of our research is to increase the event <attendance> [PRON];[Word stress]_[ˈatəndəns]and how we can do it

<Let’s move to the objectives of the research.> [LEX];[PhrasV]

First of all we should identify common pain points and factors affecting decision making process.

And also <we should find answer to the question> [GR]; [Art]_[IndefArt]

<This point also can make sense for results of our research.> [GR];[Art]_[DefArt]

Speaking of time constraints, <you said about deadline> ****[GR];[Art]_[DefArt]

Actually we have this deadline — two weeks. We are lucky.

We should discuss methods for this research: we have several options

For example a survey on social networks and face to face interviews

You have <big experience>[LEX];[Collocation] in this task and you can choose a method for this task

I am managing this interview. The goal of this interview is to identify the pain points

We will manage this interview in 30 minutes.

If you have any questions or any extra information, fill free to share it with me.
