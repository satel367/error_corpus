Let's start? How doing? Great. Today we have some questions about the product and we need to resolve it ASAP. And… I need to think… We have a problem with our users because our application have two functions, but user don't use two functions at one time. They use only one function and they separate on the start location. And it's about 20 users use finctions in one functions and others use the second function. And we need to understand what kind of problem in our application the have because our company spend money on the marketing and advertising and <the>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] planning more revenue because they <think>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] ``that users will be use two functions. But now we don't understand the problem and we call to you to understand it. Maybe you can help us <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] <this>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as s] problem.

Do you <think>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] that you need to insert some kind of analytics too to `our` application maybe? Maybe your recommendations about it. Can you recommend some kind of metrica which helps us to resolve this problem? Because it's will take a time for my developers and for understand what is it and how it works. And maybe we can to separate our time for this task. After this call I will have a call <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f]  my developer team and we will decide which kind of direction we see and thank you for your attention. I will read about all metrics and understand what metrics can be more suitable for us and which metrics Allows connect more data. (28)
