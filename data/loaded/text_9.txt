11.41 Hi, I'm Julia and I'm a new product and I wanted to meet you and introduce myself. How long have you been working at this company? I think it's great when you grow at the the same company. When you start as a junior manager and then became high specialist, so it's very cool. I had the same experience at my previous company. So, I want to introduce myself a little bit. My last work was at a med-tech startup. We did really great product and raise big group of investments. It was a system like, you know, booking. com, for medical services, like check-ups or for appointments to clinics. Firstly, I work as a junior analytic and I think it's the fact in my life with we can collaborate great because I knew something about analytics and analysts. So and after one and a half year I became a product manager and we did very nice product. If you interested or you want to do check-up. It's very good thing, I can share with you after our meeting. And so now I'm a part of your team and I want to improve <processes>[PRON];[word stress]_[prOcesses]/[PRON];[s as ts]. I want to make new cool projects with your team, I really like this company and I really like the team members which I have met yet. So it's about me. Can I ask some questions about our goals? Like, how do you see it now and maybe you can share some details about product, about team. It gonna be very great!
