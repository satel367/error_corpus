9.00 I think [PRON];[individual sound]_[th as s] everything is.. Soryvi have trouble with English this day. Give me one second to think about <words>[PRON];[individual sound]_[o as e]/[GR];[Art] {1} I think I understand everything and we can start.

The main goal of <this>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as z] research is <understanding> [GR];[Art] {1} if we need an application or not and if <need it will it address>[LEX];[Redundancy] {3} the users pain points. The objective of the research is to find <common pain points>[GR]/[Art] {1} for museum visitors and to understand the factors that affect a decision making process. The constraints of the research is time and <budget>[PRON];[individual sound]_[u as u] .We have very little time. <The>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as z] research should be finished in two weeks and we have very limited <budget>[PRON];[individual sound]_[u as u] so the research should be as cheap as possible.

12.49 I have two variants of the methods for the UX-research. The first one is <to survey on>[GR];[Prep]_[ExtraPrep] {2} the social networks and <the next two one>[GR];[Determiner] {1} is to make some face-to-face interviews. I think the UX-researcher knows better and if he <said>[PRON];[individual sound]_[d as t] that the survey is cheaper and faster let it be so. My main <goal to get >[GR];[Tenses]_[PresentS] {1} as fast and as cheap as possible. To understand should we do an application for museum visitors. And what <pain points will it close>[LEX];[WrongWord]_[IncorrectMeaning]{2}.

I <think>[PRON]; [individual sound]_[th as s] the best variant we can do is to speak with our visitors in the museum. So we can stay near the exit from the museum and ask everyone who comes out something like: "Sorry, would you answer some question please? It will help us and it will show <is the right direction>[LEX];[Redundancy]{1}."

16.40 On the one hand yes I see the problem and we have no time for lots of deep interviews, but on the another hand <I not sure>[GR];[Tenses]_[PresentSimple]{1} that we really need it. Our main goal is to understand if there are any problems we can solve with the app. And if we see that yes,  there are some problems I <think>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as s] we will have the next UX-research with lots of deep interviews to fund how can we save this problem and what <things>[PRON];[individual sound]_ [th as s] people <try now>[GR];[Tenses]_[PresentCont]{1} to solve it. And now we need just to understand <what's going wrong>[LEX];[Collocation]{2} <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_ [th as f] our customers. For example if <their>[GR];[Pronoun} {2}<said>[  as i] that <museum are boring>[GR];[Noun]_[Plural]{1} we can't do anything <with>[PRON];[th as f] our app. So I think the first votes, our research shouldn't be really deep. It is just <to become making>[LEX];[Redundancy]{2}/[GR];[Infinitive]{1} the whole picture of the situation.

I think first of all <we need meeting>[GR];[Art]{1} in which we will discuss <all our road map>[GR];[Noun]_[Plural]{1}. We will tell all the team what we want, what's our goal, why our deadlines are so important for us! During this meeting we will give the team <and opportunity to ask>[GR];[Art]_[ConjInstedArt]{2} all questions the have. And also on it we will talk who will do the work, in what deadlines and how often we will communicate with them to speak about results.

20.00 I am not sure that we will find two <senior>[PRON];[stress] researchers and I think that we can take a little bit more time to give our researchers an opportunity to speak with each other, to work with each other, to discuss all the opinions about the work to make the communication and the work as good as possible.

22.40 I think the good question would be to ask a user to walk.. to what the last time he visited museum and after it will have some information to ask other questions. What <he like> [GR];[Tenses]_[PastSimple] {1} in this visit and what points disappointed him, how often he goes to the museums and how <does museums fit>[GR];[Auxiliary]_[ExtraAux]{2} in with his all life.

Okay, my name is Anastasia and <I will leading>[GR];[Tenses]_[FutureS] {2} our conversation today. Thanks so much for taking the time, as we mentioned before, I am a product manager in Seattle Art Museum, and we are trying to do our user experience better. So now we would like to get more insights into the <process>[PRON];[individual sound]_[s as ts] the museum. And I'm here to speak with you. Just to confirm, we would like <to keep the interview 2 minutes>[GR];[Prep]{2}. Does it still <works to you>[GR];[Prep]{1}. I am happy to <hear>[PRON];[individual sound]_[i as a] it. So if you don't mind I will use recording to have us in our research and  I promise that we won't share the recording with anyone except our team. If you have some questions before I start asking you you can ask them now. So let's start. Can you please walk me through the last time you visited our museum. I see and you say that there <were really less information>[GR;[Tenses]_[PastS]{1} and it wasn't informative. Can you please tell me what information do you like to see what you are reading about exhibition.

28.00. My next question is about how you visit our website. Do you use your phone or <you use the notebook>[LEX];[Redundancy]{1} or desktop…

What do you prefer: using applications or visiting websites? I'm not speaking about our application because we don't have it now. I speak about all situations. You also said that you prefer visiting museum <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] your friends. How long, how many time it takes to communicate <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] your friends and to make a decision that "We will go to the museum together".

34.05 Let's move on to work. Let me give you a brief /?/ of UX-research we made. Our main goal was to understand how can we solve a pain points of our visitors. Here come with the results of our UX research. First of all 60 percents of our <users feeling frustrated>[GR];[Tenses]_[PresentS]{1}, annoyed and bored about visiting our websites. The main pain points are that we have little information about <opening hours the exhibitions >[GR];[Art] {1} /[GR];[Prep]{2} and most part of these users said that they decided not to visit our museum because they really need this information. The next point is that tickets can't be bought online and sometimes it's really boring. Next <that layout>[LEX];[WrongWord]_[DeterminerInsteadArt]{2} of the museum is confusing. The really don't like it and some of them said that they have… So I think we should do something <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] it!
