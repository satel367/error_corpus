Thank you for this nice attitude

We are going <to do mobile app>[LEX];[Collocation]_[VerbNoun]{1}

We <actually not really familiar with>[GR];[Auxiliary]_[Missing Auxiliary]{1} our users in terms of using <such kind of app>[GR]; [Determiner] <in their visiting> [GR];[Prep]_[Function]{1}/[LEX];[Word Formation]{2}

I would like to ask you to do user experience research

Let me <start with constraint>[GR};[IndefArt]{1}. We <have constraint>[GR];[IndefArt]{1} in terms of <constraint of time>[Syntax];[Repetition]{1}. We have time limitation, we have just 2 weeks to do this research and have some results

I invite you here today <to share research result>[GR];[IndefArt]{1}. <Which conducted our team in past weeks.>[Syntax];[WordOrder]{2}/[GR];[DefArt] {1}We had 10 interviews.

We don’t see the opening hours.

<What is your ideas?>[GR];[Auxiliary]_[Form]{1} <What could share with me>[Syntax];[MissingSubj]{2}
