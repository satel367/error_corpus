My name is Olga, <I am product manager>[GR];[IndefArt]{1} here and <now I work product manager a lot of time, for 6 or 7 years>[GR];[PresentPerfCont]{2}/[GR];[Missing Preposition]_[Function];{2} <Before I work how a developer>[GR];[PastSimple]{2}/[GR];[WrongPreposition]_[Function];{2}, <I work developer and QA>[GR];[PastSimple]{2}/[GR];[MissingngPreposition]_[Function]{2}. And <before I decide to change>[GR];[PastSimple]{2} my opportunities and <code course product manager>[LEX];[Wrong Verb]{3}/[Sintax]_[SentenStr]{3} and <after it I get certificate>[GR];[PastSimple]{2}/[GR];[IndefArt]{1} and <I start >[GR];[PastSimple]{2} to <find to work>[LEX];[WrongVerb]{3} in product manager position and <now I work product manager about 7 years.>[GR];[PresentPerfCont]{2} And I like my work it's very <interesting>[PRON];[stress]_[interEsting] <direction>[GR];[IndefArt]{1} because <I can doing>[Syntax];[SentenStr]{3} <increase my opportunities>[GR];[Infinitive]{2} and <influence on the products>[LEX];[Collocation]{3}/[GR];[ExtraPrep]{1}. More from all my opportunities I like work with designers and <analytics>[Gr];[ComparativeDegree]{2}/[LEX];[WordFormation]{2} because it's something about <creative>[PRON];[stress][a as ʌ]/[LEX];[WordFormation]{3}

  (11.56) and creating. And also I work with developers, but less because <it's only about product>[Syntax];[SentenStr]{2}. I research something with analytics team and before and after it we create a road map <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f]  developers. I have a meeting with my project manager and share my road map with her and after it we <decide what kind of features important for this product>[GR];[Auxiliary]_[MissingAux]{2} (12.47). Usually <it's 50  on the features and 50 percent>[PRON];[stress] on the <tech>[PRON];[individual sound]_[ch as h] with tasks.>[Syntax];[SentenStr]{3} And we <share>[PRON];[stress]_[a as ʌ] it <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] team[GR];[DefArt]{1} <and it's my work go on.>[Syntax];[SentenStr]{3}

14.15 I work with analytics teams and <I understand what do you do>[GR];[Word order]{2} because I have… in my university, <my specialties>[PRON];[individual sound]_[c as sh]/[PRON];[individual sound]_[extra i in lt]/[PRON];[stress]  is <a data analytics> <in a big data>[LEX];[WrongWord]{3}/[GR];[ZeroArt]{1}/[GR];[ZeroArt]{1} and it's my masters degree but <I choose connection product manager>[GR];[PastSimple]{2}/[LEX];[WrongWord]{3}/[GR];[Prep]_[Noun correlation]{2} because I use my <knowledges>[GR];[Noun countability]{1}/[PRON];[individual sound]_[ as k] in this sphere but <I decide to change my mind on more creative direction>[GR];[PastSimple]{2}/[Syntax];[WrongExpression]. Do you like your work, <what you doing?>[GR];[Question formation]{2}

Let's start? <How doing?>[GR];[Question formation]{2} Great. Today we have some <questions about the product and we need to resolve it>[GR];[WrongPronoun]{2} ASAP. And… I need to think… We have a problem with our users because <our application have two functions>[GR];[PresentSimple]{1}, but <user don't use two functions>[GR];[DefArt]{1}/[GR];[PresentSimple]{1} at one time. They use only one function and they separate on the start location. <And it's about 20 users use finctions in one functions and others use the second function.>[Syntax];[SentenceStr]{3} And we need to understand <what kind of problem in our application they have>[GR];[WordOrder]{2} because our company <spend money on the marketing>[GR];[ZeroArt]{1} and advertising and <the>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] planning more revenue because they <think>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] that <users will be use two functions.>[GR];[FutureSimple]{2} But now we don't understand the problem and <we call to you to understand it.>[GR];[ExtraPreposition]{1} Maybe you can help us <with>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as f] <this>[PRON];[individual sound]_[th as s] problem.
